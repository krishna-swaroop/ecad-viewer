 * Alternate retained scene used while one comparison target is selected on a

 * selection layer in its status colour, is the only coloured thing on screen.
 *
 * This is a board-density answer, not a general one. A schematic page shows
 * few enough changes that the composite scene's own status colour already
 * distinguishes them, and greying them out would lose more than it gains.
