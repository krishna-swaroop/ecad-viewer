/**
 * Polygon triangulation for the WebGL tesselator.
 *
 * Two implementations of the same ear-clipping algorithm: the vendored JS
 * earcut, and the same library compiled to wasm. The wasm one is ~1.5x faster
 * on the zone fills of a large board, so it is preferred, but it has to be
 * instantiated asynchronously and instantiation can fail outright (a host page
 * whose CSP forbids `wasm-unsafe-eval`, say). The JS path therefore stays as
 * the fallback rather than being deleted, and `triangulate` picks whichever is
 * available at the moment it is called.
 *
 * Correctness note: the two produce *different* triangle sets for the same
 * ring -- same area, different ear order. Nothing downstream may assume a
 * particular triangulation.
